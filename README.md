### Hi! I’m Jingyi Zhou.

- 🌱 My main research interests are NLP and Spoken Language Understanding.

- ⚡ Hobbies: history, movie.
 
- 👀 A person's life should be lived in such a way that when they look back on the past, they do not regret it for wasting their time, nor feel ashamed for a life of mediocrity. So, when on the verge of death, they can say, 'My life and all its experiences were dedicated to the grandest of causes in the world - the struggle for the liberation of humanity.
